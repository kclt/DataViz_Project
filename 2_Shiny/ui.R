# Data Visualization Final Project: NOAA Buoy Station EDA
# Author: Kevin LT Chan
# Version 1.0
# Updates:
# - Webscrapping/datascrapping [Done]
# - Buoy Station tab [Done]
# - Write Methodology [Done]
# - Create World spin gif (NASA temperature change dataset)[Done]
# - Conduct timeseries decomposition & stuff [Done]
# - Create animation tab [Done]
# - Write About [done]

#
# To do: 
# - Create stat tab[incomplete - not going to do it]
# - Collect Full Data [incomplete - too large/inconsistent formating between US and others]
